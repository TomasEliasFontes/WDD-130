      <p>
        My name is Tomás, I am taking this course because I want to learn
        everything about programming I think it will be very practical, fun and
        much easier to learn than other schools, with your help and the
        instructor, I hope with this program to be able to get a job faster and
        thus be able to support my family.

        My hobbies are going for a walk with my pet, and doing carpentry work to
        save or beautify my house.

        Iam not currently working, I am dedicating myself fully to studies
        until I find some part time.

        I have been a member of the church since I was born or rather I was born
        within the covenant, and my favorite writing is found in D&C 93:36 The
        aglory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, clight and truth.
        That I belive is someting beutiful and so true, beacuse know about the
        gospel is light and true.
